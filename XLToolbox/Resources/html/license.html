	</p>

	<p>
	(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
	Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("Utilize") the Original
	Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such
	patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original
	Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be
	necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.
	</p>

	<p>
	2.2. Contributor Grant.  Each Contributor hereby grants You a
	world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third
	party intellectual property claims:
	</p>

	<p>

	</p>

	<p>
	(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by

	reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
	Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that
	may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.
	</p>

	<h3>3. Distribution Obligations.</h3>

	<p>
	3.1. Application of License.  The Modifications which You create or
	to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
	including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of
	Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
	or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and
	You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
	Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on
	any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
	version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
	However, You may include an additional document offering the
	additional rights described in Section 3.5.
	</p>

	<p>
	3.2. Availability of Source Code.  Any Modification which You create
	or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code
	form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
	Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
	Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
	available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
	Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months
	after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
	months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
	has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
	ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
	Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
	</p>

	<p>
	3.3. Description of Modifications.  You must cause all Covered Code
	to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes
	You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You
	must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
	directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
	Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
	Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
	related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
	of the Covered Code.
	</p>

	<p>
	3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
	</p>

	<p>
	(a) Third Party Claims.  If You have knowledge that a party claims
	an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code
	(or its utilization under this License), you must include a text
	file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
	describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
	detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain
	such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as
	described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file
	in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other
	steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
	reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
	that new knowledge has been obtained.
	</p>

	<p>
	(b) Contributor APIs.  If Your Modification is an application
	programming interface and You own or control patents which are
	reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
	this information in the LEGAL file.
	</p>

	<p>
	3.5. Required Notices.  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A
	in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any
	documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients'
	rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
	Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
	notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such
	notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then
	you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
	directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
	notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
	support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
	recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
	behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
	Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
	warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
	You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
	and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
	Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
	indemnity or liability terms You offer.
	</p>

	<p>
	3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute
	Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
	Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
	include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
	Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
	description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
	Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice
	in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in
	which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code.
	You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a
	license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
	License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
	License and that the license for the Executable version does not
	attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
	version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
	the Executable version under a different license You must make it
	absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
	offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
	Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
	every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
	Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
	offer.
	</p>

	<p>
	3.7. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining
	Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
	License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
	a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
	fulfilled for the Covered Code.
	</p>

	<h3>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h3>

	<p>
	If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
	License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
	statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
	this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
	limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
	included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
	included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
	extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
	sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
	to understand it.
	</p>

	<h3>5. Application of this License.</h3>

	<p>
	This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
	attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.
	</p>

	<h3>6. Versions of the License.</h3>

	<p>
	6.1. New Versions.  Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or
	new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
	be given a distinguishing version number.
	</p>

	<p>
	6.2. Effect of New Versions.  Once Covered Code has been published
	under a particular version of the License, You may always continue
	to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to
	use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
	the License published by Floris van den Berg No one other than
	Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms applicable to
	Covered Code created under this License.
	</p>

	<p>
	6.3. Derivative Works.  If you create or use a modified version of
	this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code
	which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you
	must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "FreeImage",
	`FreeImage Public License", "FIPL", or any confusingly similar
	phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make
	it clear that your version of the license contains terms which
	differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of
	the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
	described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
	modifications of this License.)
	</p>

	<h3>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</h3>

	<p>
	COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
	WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
	INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
	FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
	NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
	THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
	DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
	OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
	REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
	ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
	AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
	</p>

	<h3>8. TERMINATION.</h3>

	<p>
	This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
	automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
	cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
	sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
	survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
	nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
	shall survive.
	</p>

	<h3>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h3>

	<p>
	UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
	(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
	DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
	CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
	ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
	CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
	LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
	FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
	LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
	APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
	PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
	LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
	LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION
	AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
	</p>

	<h3>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</h3>

	<p>
	The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
	48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
	software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
	terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
	C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
	1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
	those rights set forth herein.
	</p>

	<h3>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

	matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
	unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
