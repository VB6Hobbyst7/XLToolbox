<div class="textblock"><p>The following describes how <code>www.xltoolbox.net</code> and the XL Toolbox add-in handle personal data, according to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), article 13.</p>
<p>The "Data Controller", i.e. the person responsible for handling your data, is:</p>
<p>Dr. Daniel Kraus Versbacher Röthe 8 97078 Würzburg Germany <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'dan'+'ie'+'l@x'+'lt'+'ool'+'bo'+'x.n'+'et'; return false;">danie<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>l@xl<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>toolb<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>ox.n<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>et</a></p>
<p>When perusing the XL Toolbox website (<code>www.xltoolbox.net</code>), the XL Toolbox user forum (<code>forum.xltoolbox.net</code>), or the XL Toolbox add-in software, there are several occasions where personal data is being collected and stored that could be used to identify you as a "Data Subject".</p>
<h2>When visiting the website</h2>
<p>When visiting the website <code>www.xltoolbox.net</code>, the IP address of your internet browsing device (i.e., your laptop or your smartphone) will be recorded in server logs for a duration of 14 days. The legal grounds for this is Article 6(1) point (f) of the GDPR, i.e. a legitmate interest of the Data Controller to temporarily store IP addresses of visitors. IP addresses are one important means to identify attacks on the XL Toolbox website. You as a Data Subject have the right to request what information is stored about you in the server logs, provided you can prove that a given IP address belongs to your internet browsing device.</p>
<p>Visits to the XL Toolbox website are being statistically evaluated in an anonymous fashion. This statistical evaluation does <em>not</em> process data which may be used to identify individual visitors. Thus, it does not fall under the regulations of the GDPR.</p>
<p>The GDPR provides you with a right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority. You may chose any data-protection supervisory authority in the EU.</p>
<p>The XL Toolbox website does not use cookies. If you visited the XL Toolbox website prior to May 25, 2018, there may be remant cookies stored on your computer that the XL Toolbox does not process. You may delete these cookies. After reloading the website, your browser will display "0 cookies in use".</p>
<h2>When making a voluntary payment</h2>
<p>If you choose to make a voluntary payment ('donation') for the XL Toolbox software, you can choose one out of two payment service providers: Paypal and Stripe. Please refer to the individual payment service provider's data protection information (linked to from the payment page) to learn what personal data is collected and processed during the payment process.</p>
<p>One you have made a payment, the Data Controller (i.e., Daniel Kraus) will receive the amount along with your name and e-mail address from the payment service provider. Your name will be stored until the year after the current fiscal year. The legal grounds for this is Article 6(1) item (c), i.e. the data processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject, which is the fiscal accountability. The fiscal authority may request the balance sheet from the Data Controller.</p>
<p>If you do not wish your e-mail address to be stored in the fiscal balance sheet of the Data Processor, please refrain from making a voluntary payment.</p>
<p>The GDPR provides you with a right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority. You may chose any data-protection supervisory authority in the EU.</p>
<h2>When using the forum</h2>
<p>In order to use the forum, <code>forum.xltoolbox.net</code>, you must either provide a user name (which may be made up by you) and an e-mail address that is under your control, or use one of several third-party services to log in to the forum. If you log in with your e-mail address, that e-mail address will be stored for as long as you keep your forum account. If you log in with one of the third-party services (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github), an authentication token (a sequence of characters) will be stored on the XL Toolbox forum server in order to know that you are logged in to the forum. The third-party service will know about your use of the XL Toolbox forum.</p>
<p>The legal grounds for the storing of your e-mail address is Article 6(1) point (a) of the GDPR, i.e. your consent. If you do not want your personal data to be stored on the XL Toolbox forum server, you may use the forum without logging in. However, in that case you may only read, but not write texts on the forum.</p>
<p>The GDPR provides you with a right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority. You may chose any data-protection supervisory authority in the EU.</p>
<p>The XL Toolbox forum uses cookies which are required for the forum features to work.</p>
<h2>When downloading the XL Toolbox add-in</h2>
<p>The installer files for the XL Toolbox are served by <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>. Please see the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement">GitHub privacy statement</a> to learn if and how personal data of yours is processed when downloading the add-in.</p>
<h2>When using the XL Toolbox add-in</h2>
<p>The XL Toolbox add-in can perform periodic checks for new versions. It does so by visiting a web page (<a href="https://www.xltoolbox.net/version-ng.txt">https://www.xltoolbox.net/version-ng.txt</a>). This is the same as if you were visiting the XL Toolbox website (see above).</p>
